## Inspiration

I really appreciate the simplicity of Chrome's native tab page, but it's a bit too "simple" for my liking. While using it, I always thought it would be great if it had additional functionalities. Therefore, I decided to develop this extension. The goal is to enhance its functionality while maintaining its simplicity, providing more convenient and powerful features.

## Features

### Switching Search Engines

Users can quickly switch search engines by pressing the `tab` key after focusing on the search bar.

### Favorites List

Users can add favorites in two ways:

- After visiting a website, click on the breeze tab icon in the browser extension to pop up a form to bookmark the site. Clicking 'bookmark' will add the site to the favorites list (recommended).

- Click the `Add New` button in the favorites list and enter the URL you want to bookmark.

### Shortcut key

Users can add `shortcut key` to their bookmarked URLs. This is done by setting the `shortcut field` in the bookmark form. Once set, users can enter the shortcut field in the search box to directly navigate to that URL.

### Search Field

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To set search fields, shortcut key must be set first

Users can add `search fields` to their bookmarked URLs. This is done by setting the `shortcut field` in the bookmark form. Once set, users can use `<shortcut key>: [search content]` to directly jump to the search page of that URL and get search results.
